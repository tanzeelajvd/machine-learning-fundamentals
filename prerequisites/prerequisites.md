# Prerequisites for Machine Learning Fundamentals

This course is designed as a **core undergraduate Machine Learning course** that combines theoretical concepts with practical implementations.
It assumes that learners already possess foundational knowledge in programming, mathematics, and data analysis.

Students without the background listed below are strongly encouraged to review these topics before proceeding.

---

## 1. Programming Foundations

You should be comfortable with:

* Python programming fundamentals

  * variables, data types, conditionals
  * loops and functions
  * lists, tuples, dictionaries
* Writing and running Python scripts
* Reading and understanding error messages
* Using Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development

---

## 2. Data Analysis Foundations

Prior experience with the following is expected:

* NumPy arrays and vectorized operations
* Pandas DataFrames and Series
* Importing datasets from CSV files
* Data cleaning and handling missing values
* Basic feature selection and transformation

---

## 3. Mathematics for Machine Learning

A working understanding (conceptual, not proof-heavy) of:

### Linear Algebra

* Vectors and matrices
* Matrix operations
* Dot product and basic matrix intuition

### Probability and Statistics

* Mean, median, variance, standard deviation
* Probability distributions (basic intuition)
* Correlation and data variability
* Understanding statistical patterns in data

---

## 4. Machine Learning Basics

You should already understand:

* What Machine Learning is and when to use it
* Difference between supervised and unsupervised learning
* Features, labels, and datasets
* Model training and testing
* Train–test split and basic validation concepts
* Overfitting and underfitting (conceptual understanding)

Examples of expected familiarity:

* Linear regression
* Basic classification models

---

## 5. Data Visualization

Prior exposure to:

* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Creating line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots
* Interpreting visual trends and patterns in data

---

## 6. Recommended Background

Strongly recommended (but not mandatory):

* Prior coursework in Artificial Intelligence or Data Science
* Introductory Machine Learning lab experience
* Familiarity with at least one complete ML workflow
  (data → model → evaluation)

---

## Summary

This course **does not slow down to teach programming or mathematical fundamentals**.
Instead, it builds on existing knowledge to help you:

* Understand classical and modern machine learning algorithms
* Analyze and evaluate ML models effectively
* Apply ML techniques to real-world datasets
* Develop strong intuition for machine learning concepts

If you are unsure about any of the topics listed above, it is recommended to review them before starting this course.
